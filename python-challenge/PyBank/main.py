# * Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
#  
#  * The total number of months included in the dataset
#   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#   * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#   * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#   ```text
#   Financial Analysis
#   ----------------------------
#   Total Months: 86
#   Total: $38382578
#   Average  Change: $-2315.12
#   Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
#   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
#   ```

# * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Variables I need to track
# Count of Months - months
# Net total change in 

import os
import csv

file = os.path.join("..","Resources","budget_data.csv")

# Read in the CSV file
with open(file, 'r') as csvfile:

    # Split the data on commas
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    header = next(csvreader)

    # Loop through the data
    for row in csvreader:
        month = month + 1
        
    print(f"{month}")
